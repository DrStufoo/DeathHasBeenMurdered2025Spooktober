Hidden by the wasteland...
~playEmote("fadeIntoBarInDistance")
Inhabited by only a single man, is a bar.
This barkeep has spent centuries, unmovingly perched on his bar, waiting for any drifters to pass through.
Despite their... Affiliations.

He merely wants an honest living.

But irrelvant.
He merely wants to serve any weary travellers, so often they come.
Which is... Practically never.
Probably for the best.
~playEmote("fadeIntoBlackFromBarInDistance")

Today is different.
~playEmote("fadeIntoBarkeepApproaching")
A stranger approaches...
